I built this webpage using CSS/HTML/and JS. I used some JQuery and some vanilla JS. I actually got so caught up in building some of the elements that I guess I didn't see the idea of a radio input, so that probably made my code much more verbose (though I did implement the same functionality).

Things I didn't do and the reasons behind them:

- optimize for mobile: poor time management.
- add a "score" button: built it to automatically score and scroll to result after all questions are answered then saw the "score button" requirement and ran out of time.
