I went with a sort of retro theme because I had a really hard time choosing a font and it's really easy to work with a pixelated font.

The page is pretty simple with a couple of cool elements. The navbar, the nav elements, the middle area, 
and the footer are all flexboxes. There is an animated transition for the "Get started" button which is kind of fun and the Link Heading
buttons on narrow browsers (and mobile) takes advantage of a little "translateY()" translation feature that creates a retro-feeling 
button press animation. I really wanted to tackle the checkbox thing but I had a hard time getting the sizes to render correctly. Namely, I 
ran into an issue with bordering white space that expanded the viewport, but I had some help and figured out that setting overflow-x to hidden
solved the issue. Was a fun lab!

Cool-tip: replace the `?dl=0` on your dropbox image urls with `?raw=1` and you can embed the image!
